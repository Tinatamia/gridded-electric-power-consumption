# Global-Electric-Power-Consumption
# This project aims to produce annual global electric power consumption (EPC) dataset from 1992 to 2019, at the resolution of 1 km.
# The core idea is establishing the relationship between EPC statistics and gridded nighttime light data for each country/district.
# The final annual global EPC dataset has been released in the Google Drive. The web link is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FzK7sSzOhYRNlXY5-y1SD-IivRwyi3Fe
# This dataset is free to access for academic research. Please feel free to request download permission if your are interested in this dataset.
# Also, this dataset will also be relased in Baidu NetDisk. Specific URL will be listed here.
